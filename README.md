# Mezzanine Facebook

Simple Facebook integration for Django Mezzanine CMS

To get started add `mezzanine_facebook` to your project's `settings.py` `INSTALLED_APPS` and configure the `Facebook App ID` (and optionally `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`). Add their values in your site's admin and now you can use them like the example in `views.py`.
